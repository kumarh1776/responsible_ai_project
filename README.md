# Responsible AI Analysis
This contains the work for a Responsible AI survey clustering analysis (for final paper written by MIT Business Review).
We took a survey of > 10000 respondents to assess their sentiment towards responsible AI at their company.
Clustering and categorical analysis were the main takeaways from this project, with results published in the MIT Business Review ([url](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/building-robust-rai-programs-as-third-party-ai-tools-proliferate/)
